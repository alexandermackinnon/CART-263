# Data Visualization - 90s Music Machine

About the Project

- 90s Music Machine is a P5.js data visualization of 90s music pop music recogniton among millenials and gen Z.
- It is connected to a CSV data file containing songs and their recognition statistics for the two generations.
- In this project, I have made a program that selects a random song from the data table every 5 seconds and compares the recognition rate with circles on the left side of the screen to represent millenials and squares on the right side of the screen to represent gen Z.
- Songs with higher recognition rates fill up the screen quicker as they are given shape bigger sizes.
