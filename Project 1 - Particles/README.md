# Particles With Personalities - Aggresive & Dangerous

About the Project

- For this project, it was required to create a particle system with a personality based on a given prompt, which in this case was "Aggresive & Dangerous"
- To respond to this prompt through visualization, I wanted to create something that looks alarming, something "in-your-face".
- I made a system that is accentued by bright red colors to illustrate this sense of urgency, of dangerousness. A system that reacts very fast so that it can be perceived as aggressive.

How it Works

- The particle system is shown on a grid of rounded squares that each loop through a color and scale animation cycle.
- Upon startup, a square is selected at random on each frame and given an aggressive attribute, functioning through a boolean variable.
- Once a square turns aggressive, it starts growing and fading to a red color until reaching its max intensity, which it then sets back to its original form and goes through the animation process again.
- After a few seconds of viewing, each square will be aggressive, creating a visually interesting loop of animated particles.
